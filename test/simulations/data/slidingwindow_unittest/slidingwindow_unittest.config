# {OUTDIR}/{scaling rate}/{FILENAME_PREFIX}.{scaling rate}.fasta:  unaligned population sequences  (leafs)
# {OUTDIR}/{scaling rate}/{FILENAME_PREFIX}.{scaling rate}_ANCESTRAL.fasta:  ancestral sequences  (inner nodes)
# {OUTDIR}/{scaling rate}/{FILENAME_PREFIX}.{scaling rate}_RATES.csv:  Association of Codon Site, Mutation Scaling Rate, dN/dS Gamma Rate Class Category, expected dN/dS
# {OUTDIR}/{scaling rate}/{FILENAME_PREFIX}.{scaling rate}_TRUE.fasta:  Aligned population sequences (leafs)

# Each codon site is chosen randomly from the populations of different mutation scaling rates such at the resulting genome has each mutation scaling rate evenly represented.
